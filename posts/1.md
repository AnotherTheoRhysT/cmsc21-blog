Starting a new semester can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. We were starting fresh with new classes, new professors, and new classmates. Knowing that the classes for this semester would be mostly face-to-face we had mixed feelings about the start of the 2nd semester.
In this blog, we`ll share our experiences and feelings about our 1st week in the 2nd semester.
1. Attending classes:
It's obvious that we are required to attend our classes but we were still adjusting from the online setting of the classes to face-to-face. Each day we would contemplate going to school or not. During the 1st week of class, some professors held classes while some did not, so during this time we would wait for emails from the professors to know if they would hold classes or not. In some cases, we went to campus just to be ready in case there would be a sudden update from the professors.
2. Classes:
Classes during the 1st week of the semester almost all classes were the same. The professors would introduce themselves followed by the student then the introduction of the course would be discussed and some important dates would be given. this is mostly the same in every class, some started to discuss the lesson during the following meetings.
3. BH events
Before the semester started akhyra moved into the barriga crib, a classmate described our boarding house this way and we liked the sound of it, we had a lot of fun talking and sharing our different experiences. We would often talk about anything that we saw on social media and then sometimes rant about the classes had. We would often joke about going and attending GE classes this week because we know it would be mostly just introductions.
4. VALORANT!!!!
For this week we somewhat had a routine, we attend classes in the morning then when all classes are finished we would go back to the boardinghouse and play one game of unrated/competitive match before resting for 1hr â€“ 30 mins. After resting we would attend our afternoon classes, and right after the afternoon classes finished we would go back to the boardinghouse and play Valorant again. The Night Market, an event in valorant that let us buy discounted skins, was also opened this week we were excited to see which skin will be available for us. Both akhyra and I hated our night market because we were given duducaca skins but Rhys, on the other hand, was very lucky with his night market, he received a vandal gia skin.

In conclusion, this week was fun despite classes having started already. Our chill days have come to close as the semester have officially started.
